## Tools and APIs Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Materialize CDN
- MapQuest API
- HERE Geocoding and Search API (for COVID testing locations)
- COVID-19 Data API (via Rapid API)
- Tailor Brands (for logo)

## Challenges and Successes
- #1: Working collaboratively on GitHub --> learned how to do push and pull requests and resolve conflicts
- #2: The map and testing site APIs worked using longitiude and latitude coordinates, which is not very user friendly --> Implemented a third API that would translate a city into its longitude and latitude coordinates-- very user friendly!
- #3: Search would populate with Canada results instead of California --> Used HTML/CSS to recommend users to type the full name of the state --> Carlo helped us
